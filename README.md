# Next.js 15 Runtime Error: Module Not Found

This repository demonstrates a runtime error in a Next.js 15 application caused by attempting to import a non-existent module.  The error occurs after the application has successfully built and deployed.  This is a common issue that can be difficult to track down if not properly handled.

## Problem

The `pages/about.js` file attempts to import a module (`./nonexistent`) that does not exist. This results in a runtime error in the browser.  The error is not caught by Next.js during the build process or development mode, leading to a 500 server error in production.

## Solution

The solution is to implement proper error handling to prevent the application from crashing due to missing modules. This can be done using try-catch blocks or conditional checks to ensure that the import exists before trying to use it.
